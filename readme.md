API that plugs into databases.

Well, that'll be what it is eventually. For right now, it'll be an API that
maps models to sqlite3 databases.

Basically, I like [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/), but want to be able to
use the setup with any database I so choose, like with
[Django's](https://www.djangoproject.com/) model setup.
